<p>Having volunteered at a hospital radio station for over two years and having quite the interest in music I’ve become pretty familiar with Adobe Audtion and also Audacity.</p>
<p>Usually used for cleaning up audio to go with a video I’ve made, or compositing different audio clips together to make an opening, intro or something of the sort. I enjoy working with sound and am comfortable with working on sound related tasks.</p>
