<p>I am familiar with Illustrator for all of the basic tasks, however I have to be honest and say that's as far as it goes. For most things I usually prefer to use Photoshop as I'm more familiar with its workflow.</p>
<p>However, I'm working on improving my skills and a lot of Illustrator is just figuring out what button does what and why these things that weren't stuck together before are now moving as one! ARGH!</p>
<p>I'm fine honest... Just click another box.  I need a minute.</p>
