<p>Autodesk Maya is a program I learned to use whilst getting my degree in 3D Modelling and Animation. It is a program with a wealth of options and can do loads of cool things. I also can do these cool things! Possibly not to a great extent but good enough to get by. I've not practised a lot of the skills I once learned, but given the complexity of the program, it's something that you never forget just need to re-remember.</p>
<p>Overall I do really enjoy the program and it's uses. 3D modelling and motion graphics go hand in hand. See my showreel if you want a rough example of my work.</p>
