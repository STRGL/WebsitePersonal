<h2>Adobe Photoshop</h2>

<p>I’ve been using Adobe Photoshop since MySpace was a thing (it’s not still a thing right?) Back then being able to make your own custom pictures and backgrounds was all the rage. Since then I’ve moved on to slightly more business related work – flyers, posters, website drafts, but it’s still my most used piece of software.</p>

<p>If I need to get anything image related done then Photoshop is my first port of call. Due to my familiarity with this program my workflow is extremely quick.</p>
