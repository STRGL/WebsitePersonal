<p>To go along with my love of Motion Graphics, I also have a great love of Videography and film. Premiere Pro is my preferred program to use when working with film and I have been using it for a long time.</p> 
<p>From short films to interviews and everything inbetween, I'm familiar with the post-production process. Having not worked on anything near cinema quality size you can also assume I'm fairly familiar with the other production steps as well. I own a Canon 7D which has served me well for both photos and film. Some examples can be found by clicking on Adobe After Effects and watching my showreel.</p>
