<p>I'll be honest, I don't know why I put Citrix on here. Why's that you ask? Not because I have no experience with it, but because I wish I didn't! My experience using Citrix was mostly having to fault find as it was deployed in a environment it just couldn't support. User experience was very poor for a vast majority of users. This is the problem with inheriting a system you didn't deploy. However I did what I could and I managed to get down to only a small percentage of users with a problem by implementing several changes. If you have a Citrix system and it works flawlessy then you need to start appreciating your IT guy. Someone get that man a beer!</p>
