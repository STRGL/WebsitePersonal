<p>Well, I was kind of hoping that this website would speak for my CSS skills itself. I’m rather partial to a few CSS3 animations probably because of my interest in motion graphics. Because of my exposure to After Effects I have a decent handle of how to handle the various elements.</p>

<p>Since I started web development CSS was already in it’s 3rd iteration and therefore for me I didn’t have to deal with the changes in versions as this was the only version I was trained in.</p>
