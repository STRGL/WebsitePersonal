<p>I have experience with using Git whilst working as part of a small team where we could possibly be working on the same files at the same time. Normally we would use Putty to SSH into Github to commit changes and see differences. I've since not used Git whilst freelancing as I'm trying to understand the basics all over again. It's one thing being part of a team and following instructions but it's another entirely when deploying it yourself. I like to make sure that I'm completely clued up in the areas I need to be when there is responsibility on my shoulders. That way when it goes wrong you're not running around like a headless chicken.</p>
