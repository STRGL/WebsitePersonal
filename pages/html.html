<p>HTML is where I started off. Not technically my first foray into coding as I learned C# and C++ whilst at university (and then proceeded to forget it once I left!) but it’s definitely where I jumped back in when I decided I wanted to do web development. Having started off using HTML5 I’m familiar with a lot of the new tags and the appropriate situations to use them in.</p>
<p>HTML is not a difficult language to learn, however it is a difficult language to use correctly. Good use of HTML makes for easier SEO and will serve you well in future endeavours. </p>
