<img class="prgImg" src="../img/jquery.gif" alt="jQuery logo"><h2>jQuery</h2>
<p>What is there to say about the most popular JavaScript library out there? Not only is it very easy to use it’s also enjoyable. It was the one library that I used in order to help create this website. Whilst I am able to do a lot of it’s functions with vanilla JS it makes sense to use something to speed up the process.</p>

<p>I won’t lie and say I know every single jQuery function, neither do I know how to use them all. But I am familiar and comfortable with Jquery and its documentation. If I ever need to look something up it’s never more than a webpage away.</p>
