<p>When I first started with JavaScript it all seemed very daunting, however after practising and doing my research I now feel like I'm in a position where I can think of something that I want to do and be able to do it without assistance. This is a good feeling!</p>
<p> I am familiar with the DOM, conditionals, functions, JSON &amp; most other JavaScript techniques. Learning Javascript from the ground up also serves me well when learning other OOP languages.</p>
