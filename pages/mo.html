<p>Sigh. No matter how much you might try you can’t really get away from word processors, spreadsheets or presentations and the king of these, and almost synonymous with the words mentioned, is Microsoft Office. Whilst I am familiar with the free offerings of Libre and Open Office (the former I’m using to type this up right now!) it’s the Microsoft suite that stands out and that’s where most of my experience lies.</p>
<p>Whilst there isn’t much need for anything other than the basic functions of Microsoft Word when doing web development, and maybe not even that if you’re not required to come up with the content, it’s always good to know there’s someone in the office who can be relied upon to get a job done should you need formulas for spreadsheets or presentations done.</p>
<p>That’s me.</p>
<p>I’m that guy.</p>
