<p>I've only just started out with PHP as it seems to be a common requirement for most web developer positions. Since I have some experience with JavaScript another OOPL I'm finding it easy going so far.</p><p>I'm sure in no time this will be sitting in a green box. If you have any questions regarding my PHP experience, feel free to drop me an email.</p>
