<p>I can sing great. If I didn't want to be a web designer I'd be Ed Sheeran. Not literally of course. I lack the necessary ginger hair and guitar playing skills. However I can sing fairly well. It's just for some reason or another my voice only works at certain times. Bath time? Could be the next Micheal Jackson. Any other time? Sound like Oscar the Grouch. However I do love to sing so I would like to apologise if you happen to mistake my warbling for someone in distress.</p>
<p>If I am required to sing for my job please let me know ahead of time. I'll have the bathtub and hot water delivered.</p>
