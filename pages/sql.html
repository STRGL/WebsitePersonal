<p>My SQL experience comes from working for a working for a company with a massive database of properties and tenants. Often the only way to get the information required was to write a report. And often that job fell at my doorstep.</p>
<p>Admittedly I've never started a database of my own from the ground up &#40;barring training exercises&#41;, but you can rest assured that I have the practical experience to not melt down and burst into tears in the break room.</p>
<p>That only happened like once I promise.</p>
