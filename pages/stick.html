<p>Ok so I can sketch fairly well. But when it comes to drawing I just seem to mess up the proportions. Like, the leg bone most definitely does not connect to the arm bone. And why is his foot the same size as his WHOLE ARM?</p>
<p>However if you're into stick figures, I can draw a pretty kick ass stick man.</p>
<p>Or woman.</p>
<p>Gender equality and all that.</p>
