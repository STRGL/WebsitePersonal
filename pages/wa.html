<p>Honestly the only reason this isn't in a green box is because having had to do Windows Administration I have a great respect for those who do this kind of thing single handedly. Having taken over a system from someone else and managed alongside part of a small team I am familiar with everything from Active Directory to Group Policy and most bits inbetween.</p>

<p>For most normal questions asked by people around the office I'm usually the guy to turn to. Just be warned if you want me to help, I will help. And people will  ask. And I will spend most of my time fixing Joanna's computer as it can't seem to print in duplex like she wanted it to, instead of making a cool fancy new website.</p>

<p>You've been warned.</p>
